# Create IC

A simple command line tool to quickly create projects for the [Internet Computer](https://smartcontracts.org/).

## Usage

> Note that you will need to use npm 6 or higher.

```bash
npm init ic
```

An optional project name can also be passed to the command line:

```bash
npm init ic myproject
```

## What does it actually do?

This [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-init) initializer is basically a shorthand to [dfx](https://smartcontracts.org/docs/current/references/cli-reference/dfx-parent/) - the command-line interface for managing Internet Computer projects.

1. It first checks if dfx is installed in your environment. If not, it prompts you to install it
2. If already installed, the script checks if a newer version of dfx is available and prompts you if you want to upgrade
3. Request a new project name
4. Ask what kind of project should be initialized - i.e. frontend (web application) + backend or backend only
5. Let you pick the type of backend canister that should be created (Motoko or Rust)
6. If a frontend web application should be created, it also asks you if an authentication ([Internet Identity](github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/)) should be added to the project
7. Initialize the new project

## Limitation

It does not support yet Windows and might also not work behind a proxy.
